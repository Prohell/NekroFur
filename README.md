# NekroFur
Thank you for checking out NekroFur!
I have uploaded the original V2.1 source files for NeoFur in the hopes of collaborating and updating the project to be compatible 
with Unity 2018 and *maybe* the Scriptable Render Pipeline

I am not a shader programmer and I don't know enough about this to fix it myself, so I have it here in the hopes someone 
with the time and interest can revive what is possibly the best fur shader in existance
